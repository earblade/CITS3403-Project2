                E-Commerce Apps
                E-commerce apps like Amazon, Flipkart, Nykaa, etc. have become an integral part of our lives. Every
                business owner is coming up with their own apps to survive the tough competition. So, if you have
                hands-on experience with building functional e-commerce react apps, it will make you more saleable in
                the development industry.
                <br><br>
                Keep in mind that weâ€™re talking about developing a small e-commerce project that is focused more on a
                particular industry, you can choose any industry that interests you like- mobiles, TVs, laptops, etc.
                and develop your e-commerce app around that.
                <br><br>
                Your e-commerce app can ensure the delivery of products or services along with browsing products or
                services.
                <br><br>
                Also, customers can enjoy seamless customer service.
                <br><br>
                All-round customer support and good customer experience are two vital elements of any successful app, so
                make sure customers can enjoy seamless customer service with your ReactJS projects for beginners.
                <br><br>
                As far as features of the e-commerce app are concerned-
                <br><br>
                Keep the layout and interface neat and easy-to-navigate,
                Include the location option for deliveries, add a shopping cart, and a wishlist.
                Make sure the checkout process incorporates the necessary authentication options (as a guest or
                registered user).
